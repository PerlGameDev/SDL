NAME
    SDL Perl - Simple DirectMedia Layer for Perl

SYNOPSIS
    use SDL;

DESCRIPTION
    SDL Perl is a package of Perl modules that provide both functional and
    object oriented interfaces to the Simple DirectMedia Layer for Perl 5.
    This package takes some liberties with the SDL API, and attempts to adhere
    to the spirit of both the SDL and Perl.
