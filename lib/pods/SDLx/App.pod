=head1 NAME

SDLx::App - a SDL perl extension

=head1 CATEGORY

Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL;
    use SDLx::App; 
    use SDL::Event;
    use SDL::Events; 
    
    my $app = SDLx::App->new( 
        title  => 'Application Title',
        width  => 640,
        height => 480,
        depth  => 32
    ); 

This is the manual way of doing things

    my $event = SDL::Event->new; # create a new event 
    
    SDL::Events::pump_events();
       
    while ( SDL::Events::poll_event($event) ) { 
        my $type = $event->type(); # get event type 
        print $type; 
        exit if $type == SDL_QUIT; 
    }

An alternative to the manual Event processing is the L<SDLx::App::loop>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SDLx::App> controls the root window of the of your SDL based application.
It extends the L<SDL::Surface> class, and provides an interface to the window
manager oriented functions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

C<SDLx::App::new> initializes the SDL, creates a new screen,
and initializes some of the window manager properties.
C<SDLx::App::new> takes a series of named parameters:

=over 4

=item * title
the window title. Defaults to the file name. Shorter alias: 't'

=item * icon_title
the icon title. Defaults to file name. Shortcut: 'it'

=item * icon
the icon itself. Defaults to none. Shortcut: 'i'

=item * width
Window width, in pixels. Defaults to 800. Shortcut: 'w'

=item * height
Window height, in pixels. Defaults to 600. Shortcut: 'h'

=item * depth
Screen depth. Defaults to 16. Shortcut: 'd'.

=item * flags
Any flags you want to pass to L<SDL::Video> upon initialization. Defaults to SDL_ANYFORMAT. Flags should be I<or'ed> together if you're passing more than one (flags => FOO|BAR). Shortcut: 'f'.

=item * resizeable
Set this to a true value to make the window resizeable by the user. Default is off.

=back


=head2 title()

=head2 title( $new_title )

=head2 title( $window_title, $icon_title )

C<SDLx::App::title> takes 0, 1, or 2 arguments. If no parameter is given,
it returns the current application window title. If one parameter is
passed, both the window title and icon title will be set to its value.
If two parameters are passed the window title will be set to the first,
and the icon title to the second.

=head2 delay( $ms )

C<SDLx::App::delay> takes 1 argument, and will sleep the application for
that many ms.

=head2 ticks

C<SDLx::App::ticks> returns the number of ms since the application began.

=head2 error

C<SDLx::App::error> returns the last error message set by the SDL.

=head2 resize( $width, $height )

C<SDLx::App::resize> takes a new width and height of the application. Only
works if the application was originally created with the resizable option.

=head2 fullscreen

C<SDLx::App::fullscreen> toggles the application in and out of fullscreen mode.

=head2 iconify

C<SDLx::App::iconify> iconifies the application window.

=head2 grab_input( $CONSTANT )

C<SDLx::App::grab_input> can be used to change the input focus behavior of
the application. It takes one argument, which should be one of the following:

=over 4

=item * SDL_GRAB_QUERY

=item * SDL_GRAB_ON

=item * SDL_GRAB_OFF

=back

=head2 loop( \%actions )

C<SDLx::App::loop> is a simple event loop method which takes a reference to a hash
of event handler subroutines. The keys of the hash must be SDL event types such
as SDL_QUIT(), SDL_KEYDOWN(), and the like. When called, the event method recieves
as its parameter the event object used in the loop.
 
Example:

    my $app = SDLx::App->new(
        title  => "test.app", 
        width  => 800, 
        height => 600, 
        depth  => 32
    );
    
    my %actions = (
        SDL_QUIT()    => sub { exit(0); },
        SDL_KEYDOWN() => sub { print "Key Pressed" },
    );
    
    $app->loop( \%actions );

=head2 sync

C<SDLx::App::sync> encapsulates the various methods of syncronizing the screen with the
current video buffer. C<SDLx::App::sync> will do a fullscreen update, using the double buffer
or OpenGL buffer if applicable. This is prefered to calling flip on the application window.

=head2 attribute( $attr )

=head2 attribute( $attr, $value )

C<SDLx::App::attribute> allows one to get and set GL attributes. By passing a value
in addition to the attribute selector, the value will be set. C<SDL:::App::attribute>
always returns the current value of the given attribute, or croaks on failure.
