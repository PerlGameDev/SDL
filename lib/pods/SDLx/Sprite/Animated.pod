=head1 NAME

SDLx::Sprite::Animated - create animated SDL sprites easily!

=head1 CATEGORY

Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SDLx::Sprite::Animated;

  # simplest possible form, where 'hero.png' is an image containing
  # fixed-length sprites in sequence. It doesn't matter if they are
  # placed vertically or horizontally, as long as the the widest
  # side is a multiple of the (narrowest) other. The widget will
  # automatically divide it in the proper frames, provided there is
  # no slack space between each frame.

  my $animation = SDLx::Sprite::Animated->new->load('hero.png');

  # that's it! Defaults are sane enough to DWIM in simple cases,
  # so you just have to call draw() on the right place. If you
  # need to setup your animation or have more control over it,
  # feel free to use the attributes and methods below.

  # these are the most useful methods to use in your game loop
  # (or wherever you want to manipulate the animation):
  $animation->next;
  $animation->previous;
  $animation->reset;

  $animation->current_frame;   # current frame number
  $animation->current_loop;    # current loop number

  # you can control positioning just like a regular SDLx::Sprite:
  $animation->rect
  $animation->x;
  $animation->y;

  # just like a regular Sprite, we fetch our source rect from ->clip,
  # updating it on each call to ->next (or ->previous, or ->reset).
  # If source rects for your animation are further appart (or less)
  # than the rect's width and height, you can adjust the animation
  # x/y offsets:
  $animation->step_x(15);
  $animation->step_y(30);

  $animation->draw($screen); # remember to do this! :)

  # we can also call ->next() automatically after each draw():
  $animation->start;
  $animation->stop;

  # default is to go to the next frame at each draw(). If this is
  # too fast for you, change the attribute below:
  $animation->ticks_per_frame(10);

  # select type of animation loop when it reaches the last frame:
  $animation->type('circular'); # restarts loop at the beginning
  $animation->type('reverse');  # goes backwards

  $animation->max_loops(3); 0 or undef for infinite looping


  # as usual, you can setup most of the above during object spawning
  my $animation = SDLx::Sprite::Animated->new(
                       image  => 'hero.png',
                       rect   => SDL::Rect->new(...),
                       step_x => 20,
                       step_y => 0,
                       ...
                  );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

An animation is a series of frames that are played in order. Frames are
loaded from an image, usually referred to as a Sprite Sheet or Sprite Strip.

This module let's you interact with such strips and create sprite animations
just as easily as you would manipulate a regular SDLx::Sprite object.

=head1 WARNING! VOLATILE CODE AHEAD

This is a new module and the API is subject to change without notice.
If you care, please join the discussion on the #sdl IRC channel in
I<irc.perl.org>. All thoughts on further improving the API are welcome.

You have been warned :)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS

SDLx::Sprite::Animated is a B<subclass> of L<< SDLx::Sprite >>, inheriting
all its attributes and methods. Please refer to that module's documentation
for information on those.

The one difference in behavior is that, while a standard SDLx::Sprite uses
C<< ->clip() >> to select the part of the surface to display,
SDLx::Sprite::Animated treats C<< ->clip() >> as the B<initial> rect, from
which to start the animation.

The following attributes and methods are available:

=head2 new

=head2 new( %options )

Creates a new SDLx::Sprite::Animated object. No option is mandatory. It
accepts all the options from a regular SDLx::Sprite object plus these:

=over 4

=item * step_x => $integer

Uses $integer as the number of pixels to move on the x-axis (left-to-right,
0 being no dislocation whatsoever, when the strip goes from top to bottom)
to reach the next frame.

=item * step_y => $integer

Uses $integer as the number of pixels to move on the y-axis (top-to-bottom,
0 being no dislocation whatsoever, when the strip goes from left to right)
to reach the next frame.

=item * max_loops => $integer

Uses $integer as the number of times to loop the animation (when it reaches
the end of the strip).

=item * ticks_per_frame => $integer

Uses $integer to set how many calls to draw() must be issued before we go to
the next frame during autoplay (i.e. between calls to start() and stop()).

=item * type => $string

Uses $string to set the type of animation loop when it reaches the last
frame in the strip. See the type() method below for information on
available looping types.

=back

=head2 step_x()

=head2 step_x( $integer )

Uses $integer as the number of pixels to move on the x-axis (left-to-right,
0 being no dislocation whatsoever, when the strip goes from top to bottom)
to reach the next frame.

Defaults to the same width as the clip() rect.

=head2 step_y()

=head2 step_y( $integer )

Uses $integer as the number of pixels to move on the y-axis (top-to-bottom,
0 being no dislocation whatsoever, when the strip goes from left to right)
to reach the next frame.

Defaults to the same height as the clip() rect.

=head2 max_loops()

=head2 max_loops( $integer )

Uses $integer as the number of times to loop the animation (when it reaches
the end of the strip). After that B<< all calls to previous() or next() will be no-ops >>.

Set it to C<0> or C<undef> to allow infinite loops. Default is 0 (infinite).

=head2 ticks_per_frame()

=head2 ticks_per_frame( $integer )

Uses $integer to set how many calls to draw() must be issued before we go to
the next frame during autoplay (i.e. between calls to start() and stop()).

Default is just 1 tick per frame, so you might want to change this if it's too fast.

=head2 type()

=head2 type( $string )

Uses $string to set the type of animation loop when it reaches the last
frame in the strip. Available looping types are:

=over 4

=item * 'circular'

Restarts loop at the beginning of the strip. If you have 4 frames, the flow
will be 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1-2-... up until the number of loops you
set in the max_loops() attribute.

=item * 'reverse'

Loops back and forth on the strip. If you have 4 frames, the flow will be
1-2-3-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-3-2-... up until the number of loops you set in the
max_loops() attribute.

=back

Case is irrelevant for type(), so for example 'Circular', 'CIRCULAR' and
'CiRcUlAr' are all accepted as 'circular'. The return value is guaranteed
to be lowercase.

Default value is 'circular'.

=head2 next()

Goes to the next frame in the strip. Calling this method will also reset
the tick counter used by ticks_per_frame().

If max_loops() has reached its limit, this will be a no-op.

Returns the object, allowing method chaining.

=head2 previous()

Goes to the previous frame in the strip. Calling this method will also reset
the tick counter used by ticks_per_frame().

If max_loops() has reached its limit, this will be a no-op.

Returns the object, allowing method chaining.

=head2 reset()

Goes to the first frame in the strip, meaning whatever clip is set to.

If max_loops() has reached its limit, this will be a no-op.

Returns the object, allowing method chaining.

=head2 current_frame()

Returns the current frame number. Note that this is 1-based (first frame
is 1, second is 2, etc).

=head2 current_loop()

Returns the loop counter, i.e. which run number is it at. This is also
1-based (first time is 1, second time is 2, etc). Note that we only
keep track of the counter if max_loops() is set to a finite number. Otherwise,
this will be a no-op.

=head1 start()

After you call this method, the object will issue a call to C<< ->next() >>
automatically for you every time C<< ->draw() >> is called
C<< ticks_per_frame() >> times.

If you want to stop autoplay, see C<< stop() >> below.

Default is off (no autoplay).

=head1 stop()

Stops autoplay. After you call this, the object will need you to call
C<< ->previous() >> and C<< ->next() >> explicitly to change frames.

To resume autoplay from wherever you are, use C<< start() >>.

If you want to restart autoplay from the initial frame, just do:

  $sprite->reset->start;
