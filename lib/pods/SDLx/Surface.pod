=head1 NAME

SDLx::Surface - Graphic surface matrix extension

=head1 CATEGORY

Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use SDL;
 use SDL::Video;
 use SDLx::Surface;

 # Create the main surface (display)
 SDL::init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
 my $display = SDL::Video::set_video_mode(640, 480, 16, SDL_SWSURFACE);

 my $surf_matrix = SDLx::Surface->new( surface => $display);
 
 $surf_matrix->[10][10] = 0xFFFF; #for 16bpp write white at x = 10 and y=10

 $surf_matrix->surface( $new_surface );

 my $orig_surface = $surf_matrix->surface();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An C<SDLx::Surface> allows matrix read and write to a surface, safely. 

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR 

=head2 new

Takes a SDL::Surface in hash format.

If a surface is passed to 'surface =>' that is loaded. Otherwise you can define at least a width and a height. 

	SDLx::Surface->new(  surface => $surface) # The $surface is loaded

	SDLx::Surface->new( width=> 400, height=>200) 
		# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_ANYFORMAT, 400, 200, 32) is loaded

	SDLx::Surface->new( width=> 400, height=>200, flags=> SDL_SWSURFACE, depth=>24 ) 
	  	# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_SWSURFACE, 400, 200, 24) is loaded 

	SDLx::Surface->new( width=> 400, height=>200, flags=> SDL_SWSURFACE, depth=>32, greenmask=>0xFF000000 )
		# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_ANYFORMAT, 400, 200, 32, 0, 0xFF000000,0, 0, 0 ) is loaded
	SDLx::Surface->new( w => 1, h => 1, color => 0xFF0000FF )
		# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_ANYFORMAT, 1, 1, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) is loaded
		all pixels are colored with color (red)

=head2 display

If L<SDLx::App::new|SDLx::App/"new"> or L<SDL::Video::get_video_mode|SDL::Video/"get_video_mode"> called before then:

 my $appx = SDLx::Surface::display(); 

gets the display if it is already made. Passed options are ignored. Otherwise you can quickly make the display with :

 SDLx::Surface::display( width => 20, height => 20) #depth => 32 and SDL_ANYFORMAT used

or you can also pass flags and depth. 

 SDLx::Surface::display( width => 20, height => 20, flags=> SDL_HWSURFACE, depth=>24) 

You can also use the keys C<w> and C<h> in place of C<width> and C<height>, as with C<new>.

Get or create the main display surface and attach to a C<SDLx::Surface>.

=head2 duplicate

Does a attributes only, no pixel, copy of another SDLx::Surface. 

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 surface

If a SDL::Surface is passed it is attached to the matrix. Returns the SDL::Surface that is currently attached to this SDLx::Surface

=head2 w, h, format, pitch, flags

Returns the inner SDL::Surface's respective attribute. See C<SDL::Surface>.

=head2 clip_rect

Sets the passed C<SDL::Rect> as the new clip_rect for the surface. Returns the SDL::Surface's clip_rect. See 
L<SDL::Video::get_clip_rect|SDL::Video/"get_clip_rect"> and L<SDL::Video::set_clip_rect|SDL::Video/"set_clip_rect">.
=head1 EXTENSIONS

=head2 load

 my $surface = SDLx::Surface->load( 'hero.png' );
 my $surface = SDLx::Surface->load( 'hero.dat', 'bmp' );

Loads the given image file into a I<new> SDLx::Surface surface. A new
surface is B<always> created, even if you call it from an already crafted
object. Croaks on errors such as no support built for that image extension
or a file reading error (the error message is SDL::get_error and should
give more details).

Note that load() will automatically figure out the extension based on the
filename you provide. If you wish to force an extension for whatever reason
(like having a filename with a different extension or none at all), you can
optionally pass the file type as a second parameter. Case is not relevant.

If you don't have SDL_image in your build, only bitmap images will be
supported.

Returns the new Surface.


=head2 blit 

 $sdlx_surface->blit( $dest, $src_rect, $dest_rect );

Blits C<SDLx::Surface> onto $dest surface. 
$src_rect or $dest_rect are optional. If $src_rect is ommited, it will be the size of the entire surface. If $dest_rect is ommited, 
it will be blitted at C<(0, 0)>. $src_rect or $dest_rect can be array refs or C<SDL::Rect>. $dest can be C<SDLx::Surface> or C<SDL::Surface>.

Note that the final blit rectangle is stored in $dest_rect after clipping is performed.

Returns $self

=head2 blit_by

 $sdlx_surface->blit_by( $src, $src_rect, $dest_rect );

Does the same as C<blit> but the C<SDLx::Surface> is the one being blitted to.
This is useful when the surface you have isn't an C<SDLx::Surface>, but the surface it is being blitted to is.

Note that the final blit rectangle is stored in $dest_rect after clipping is performed.

=head2 flip

Applies L<SDL::Video::flip|SDL::Video/"flip"> to the Surface, with error checking.

Returns $self

=head2 update

 $sdlx_surface->update(); # whole surface is updated
 $sdlx_surface->update([0,0,1,1]); # only that area (0,0,1,1) is updated
 
 $sdlx_surface->update( [ SDL::Rect->new(0,0,1,2) ... ]); # defined rects are updated

Applies L<SDL::Video::update_rect|SDL::Video/"update_rect"> for no rect or 1 array ref. Applies 
L<SDL::Video::update_rects|SDL::Video/"update_rects"> for array of L<SDL::Rect>s. 

Returns $self


=head2 draw_rect

 $sdlx_surface->draw_rect( [$x,$y,$w,$h], 0xFFFF00FF );
 $sdlx_surface->draw_rect( SDL::Rect->new($x,$y,$w,$h), 0xFFFF00FF );
