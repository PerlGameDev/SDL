=head1 NAME

SDL::Time - An SDL Perl extension for managing timers

=head1 CATEGORY

Core

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use threads;
 use threads::shared;

 use SDL ':all';
 use SDL::Time;

 package foo;

 SDL::init(SDL_INIT_TIMER);

 my $tick :shared = 0;
 sub ticker { $tick++; warn $tick; return 100; }

 package main;

 my $id = SDL::Time::add_timer(100, 'foo::ticker');

 sleep(2);

 SDL::Time::remove_timer($id);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_timer(interval, callback)

This runs in a separate thread and a cloned Perl thread.

The C<callback> function, specified with a string of the function's name, will be called after the milliseconds of C<interval> have elapsed.
The actual delay may be longer than specified depending on the underlying OS.
The callback function is passed the current timer interval as well as the C<interval> parameter and should return the next timer interval.
If the return value from the callback is 0, the timer is cancelled; otherwise, the timer will continue to run.

The timer callback function may run in a different thread to your main program, so it shouldn't call any functions from within itself.
You may call SDL::push_event, however.

C<SDL::Time::add_timer> returns the identifier value of the generated timer or undef on error.

B<Note:> You must initialize (C<SDL::init>) the timer subsystem to use this function.

=head2 remove_timer(id)

The other way to cancel a timer is to use C<SDL::Time::remove_timer> on the C<id> of a timer.
This C<id> is the return value of the C<SDL::Time::remove_timer> function.

C<SDL::Time::remove_timer> returns C<0> on success or C<-1> on error.
