=head1 RELEASES

=head2 2.xxx

SDLx::App had a full rewrite and SDLx::Controller was updated.

=over

=item SDLx::App

Shortcut aliases in the constructor have been changed and removed. The main ones people use are still there like
C<w>, C<h> and C<d>. These lesser used ones no longer work: C<t>, C<it>, C<i>, C<s>, C<ab>, C<db>, C<bs>, C<st>, C<asyncblit>.

C<warp> was renamed to C<warp_cursor>, but this method wasn't documented before anyway.

All OpenGL parameters for the constructor now have a C<gl_> prefix. These were never documented,
so they're not listed here.

The OpenGL method C<attribute> is now called C<gl_attribute>.

C<delay> has been removed and replaced with SDLx::Controller's C<sleep>. C<ticks> has been deprecated, but left in
for backcompat.

=item SDLx::Controller

The C<eoq> parameter and method have been removed. The exit on quit (stop on quit) action is now enabled by default.
The C<stop_handler> parameter and method are now used to change and disable the quit action of the app.

C<max_t> will now slow the application down if it runs at less than 10 FPS, by default.

=back

=head2 2.517

Major changes to C<SDLx::Controller>.

C<quit> is now C<stop>. Event handlers no longer end C<run> on returning false. Call C<stop> explicitly instead.

The first argument to move handlers is the step portion instead of C<dt>.
The second argument to move handlers, the C<t> value, is now the third argument.

C<min_t> will limit apps to a framerate of 60 by default.

=head2 2.513

=item SDLx::App

C<SDLx::App::loop()> is deprecated.

=back

=head2 2.502

=over

=item SDLx::App

Now depends on L<SDLx::Surface>. To get the SDL::Surface, use C< ->surface() >. Alternatively L<SDLx::Surface::display()|SDLx::Surface/display>.

=item SDLx::Surface

C< get_display > is now called L<SDLx::Surface::display|SDLx::Surface/display>. 

=item SDLx::Sprite::Animated

Has drastically changed, and is still volatile.

=back

=head2 2.500

=over 

=item SDL::App 

SDL::App has migrated to SDLx::App namespace. The reason for this is because it is an extension and not a 1:1 XS/Constant Module to the c library.

=item SDL::Game::Rect 

SDL::Game::Rect has migrated to SDLx::Rect namespace. Same reasoning as above.
