SDL::GFX::Framerate - framerate calculating functions

=head1 CATEGORY

GFX

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The framerate functions are used to insert delays into the graphics loop to maintain a constant framerate.

=head1	METHODS

=head2	init

 use SDL;
 use SDL::GFX::Framerate;
 use SDL::GFX::FPSManager;

 my $fps = SDL::GFX::FPSManager->new(0, 0, 0, 0);
 
 SDL::GFX::Framerate::init($fps);

Initialize the framerate manager, set default framerate of 30Hz and reset delay interpolation.

=head2	set

 SDL::GFX::Framerate::set($fps, 60);

Sets the new desired framerate to 60 frames per second.

=head2	get

 my $rate = SDL::GFX::Framerate::get($fps);

Get the currently set framerate of the manager.

=head2	delay

 SDL::GFX::Framerate::delay($fps);

Generate a delay to accommodate the currently set framerate. Call once in the graphics/rendering loop. 
If the computer cannot keep up with the rate (i.e. drawing too slow), the delay is zero and the delay interpolation is reset.
