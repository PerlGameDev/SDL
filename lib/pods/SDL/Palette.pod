=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each pixel in an 8-bit surface is an index into the colors field of the C<SDL::Palette> structure store in C<SDL::PixelFormat>. A C<SDL::Palette>
should never need to be created manually. It is automatically created when SDL allocates a C<SDL::PixelFormat> for a surface. The colors 
values of a C<SDL::Surface>'s palette can be set with the C<SDL::Video::set_colors>.
