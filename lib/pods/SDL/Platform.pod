SDL::Platform - Platform Specific Informations about SDL Perl

=head1 CATEGORY

Documentation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes OS specific informations regading the installation and use of L<SDL>.

=head2 General (all OS)

You need to install L<Alien::SDL> to acquire all prerequisites of L<SDL>.

On Windows, L<Alien::SDL> will get you zip-files containing prebuilt libs.

On Unixes you can choose between compiling libs or use libs provided by the dist.
The different options on Unixes are availale when requirements are met. Like having specific libs installed.

There is some additional documentation in the L<Github-Wiki|https://github.com/PerlGameDev/SDL/wiki/Testing>.
You definitively want to look there, if you want to know how to install L<SDL> from the latest sources (e.g. in an unfinished, unreleased state).

=head1 Windows

=head2 Installation

We recommend Strawberry Perl. You can get it L<here|http://strawberryperl.com/>.

Once you installed Strawberry Perl, you can access the cpan shell via the start menu.

Open up the cpan shell and type C<install Alien::SDL SDL>. Please follow the dialog and answer the questions to the best of your knowledge.

=head1 Mac OS X

=head2 Installation

You will need a newer version of Perl that you can install with L<App::perlbrew>.

Once you have a newer Perl installed please use C<cpan> to install L<Alien::SDL> (and of course L<SDL>).

=head2 Using SDL on Mac OS X

You can't use the C<perl> executable to run SDL scripts on Mac OS X, you need to use C<SDLPerl>.
When you install L<SDL>, a program named C<SDLPerl> is installed. It should be in your path.

Using Mac OS X, your SDL Perl script have to look like this:

  #!SDLPerl

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use SDL;
  # your code here ...

Using the wrong Perl executable, you might encounter a lot of error messages resulting in C<terminate called after throwing an instance of 'NSException'>.
cf. the corresponding L<github issue|https://github.com/PerlGameDev/SDL/issues/208>.
