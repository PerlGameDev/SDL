=head1 NAME

SDL::AudioCVT -- Audio Conversion Structure

=head1 CATEGORY

Core, Audio, Structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<SDL::AudioCVT> is used to convert audio data between different formats. A C<SDL::AudioCVT> structure is created with the 
C<SDL::AudioCVT->build> function, while the actual conversion is done by the C<SDL::Audio::convert_audio> function. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This constructor returns an empty C<SDL::AudioCVT> structure.

=head2 build

 $cvt = SDL::AudioCVT->build( $src_format, $src_channels, $src_rate
                              $dst_format, $dst_channels, $dst_rate );

Before an C<SDL::AudioCVT> structure can be used to convert audio data it must be initialized with source and destination information.

C<src_format> and C<dst_format> are the source and destination format of the conversion. (For information on audio formats see 
C<SDL::AudioSpec>). C<src_channels> and C<dst_channels> are the number of channels in the source and destination formats. 
Finally, C<src_rate> and C<dst_rate> are the frequency or samples-per-second of the source and destination formats. Once again, 
see C<SDL::AudioSpec>.

Currently (SDL-1.2.11) only rate conversions of 2x and (1/2)x with x > 0 are done, nearing the requested rate conversion. 

See C<SDL::Audio::convert_audio>.

=head2 needed

Set to one if the conversion is possible

=head2 src_format

Audio format of the source

=head2 dest_format

Audio format of the destination

=head2 rate_incr

Rate conversion increment

=head2 len

Length of the original audio buffer in bytes

=head2 len_cvt

Length of converted audio buffer in bytes (calculated)

=head2 len_mult

C<buf> must be C<len*len_mult> bytes in size (calculated)

=head2 len_ratio

Final audio size is C<len*len_ratio>
